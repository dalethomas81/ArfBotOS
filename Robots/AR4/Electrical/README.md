# Electrical Drawings
The AR4 robot comes with a very detailed build guide that includes electrical diagrams. For ArfBotOS, we will need to modify the electrical diagram slightly so that we can make use of the i2c port of the Teensy controller.

This directory will serve as the repository for those changes. For now this is TODO.

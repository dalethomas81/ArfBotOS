# ArfBot EggMaker
As a way to qualify the capabilities of the software, I wanted to complete a tangible project that would help me find bugs and add features to the software.

Since making breakfast is one of my favorite past times, I figured building the tooling and process to crack, cook, and serve an egg would be a perfect project for this.

Included in this directory will at a minimum be the CAD files and some videos of the project.
